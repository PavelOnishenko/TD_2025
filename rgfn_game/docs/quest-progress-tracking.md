# Quest progress tracking notes

## Problem fixed
- Some location-based objectives (for example `Scout Oakcross` with condition `Enter Oakcross.`) were not visibly marked as completed in the quest panel after entering the target village.

## Current behavior
- A dedicated progress tracker now marks leaf objectives as completed when the player enters a matching village name.
- Supported objective types for this automatic location completion are currently:
  - `travel`
  - `scout`
- Name matching is case-insensitive.
- Parent composite nodes automatically become completed when all children are completed.

## UI behavior
- Completed quest nodes render with:
  - a leading checkmark (`✓`)
  - a completed visual style (`.quest-node.is-completed`)
- The quest panel is re-rendered immediately after progress changes.

## Integration points
- `QuestProgressTracker` owns runtime completion evaluation.
- `Game` records location entry when entering village mode and forwards this to the tracker.
- `QuestUiController` renders completion state using `QuestNode.isCompleted`.

## Follow-up opportunities
- Persist quest completion in save data.
- Expand tracker events for non-location objective types (`deliver`, `barter`, `escort`, etc.).
- Show quest completion notifications in battle log / village log.
