Prototype 5 — Balance, UX polish, and CrazyGames readiness

Main Goal:
Make the game feel more complete and ready for publishing on CrazyGames by fixing the balance, adding start/end screens, polishing user feedback, and integrating a minimal ad flow. The work should fit within 3–4 hours of joint development with Codex.

Balance

Adjust enemy HP and gold rewards so that all 10 waves are beatable but still challenging.

Ensure wave 10 is hard but fair.

UX & UI

Add a Start Menu with a “Start Game” button before the first wave.

Add a simple End Screen (Win/Lose) with a “Restart” button.

Make the loop (start → play → end → restart) clear and intuitive.

Feedback & Effects

Add a short visual or sound effect when placing a tower (flash on cell or small SFX).

Play an error SFX when the player tries to build without enough gold.

CrazyGames Integration

On Game Over, trigger a CrazyGames interstitial ad to test monetization flow.

Result:
The game becomes playable through all waves with a balanced difficulty curve. Players experience clear start and end points, better feedback for their actions, and a first working ad integration. This version looks and feels “finished enough” to be shown to CrazyGames as a minimal but complete prototype.
