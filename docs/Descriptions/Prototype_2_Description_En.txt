What it is: an evolution of Prototype #1. The player now places towers on limited build spots along the straight enemy path, starts waves with a button, and the game tracks gold, lives, and wave progress.

What’s in the game
Field: enemies follow the same straight road as in Prototype #1, but it now has 10 marked spots for building towers.

HUD: above the canvas, display Lives (10), Gold (15), current Wave (1/5), and two buttons — “Next Wave” and “Place Tower (10)”.

Building: clicking “Place Tower (10)” enables build mode and highlights the button when active.
Hovering over a build spot highlights it green if buildable and affordable, or red if blocked or unaffordable.
Clicking a green spot places a tower, subtracts 10 Gold, and marks the spot as occupied. There are no pre-placed towers — the one from Prototype #1 is removed.

Enemy movement: enemies still move along the straight road, same as in Prototype #1.

Wave start: “Next Wave” starts the current wave, disables itself until the wave ends, and spawns enemies along the road.

Enemies: each enemy has a visible HP bar above it.
Towers target the first enemy entering range and keep firing at it while it’s in sight; when it leaves range, the tower picks the next target.

Economy: killing an enemy grants +1 Gold, instantly updating the HUD. If an enemy reaches the base, it disappears and Lives decrease by 1.

Waves: when all enemies are gone, “Next Wave” becomes active again, Wave increases by 1, and +3 Gold is awarded.
Enemy HP increases each wave according to a simple built-in scheme.

Endgame: after Wave 5 and all enemies are destroyed, the HUD shows “WIN” and the game stops.
If Lives reach 0, the HUD shows “LOSE” and the game stops.

Restart: a “Restart” button resets Lives, Gold, Wave, and clears all towers and enemies.
