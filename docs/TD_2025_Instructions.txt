# Codex Instructions

For each task for a current prototype:

1. Make only the changes required to complete the task.
2. Modify tests to reflect the change. Remove those unneeded, add those that will be valuable for new logic on the current stage.
3. Perform in a simple and efficient way.
4. Code should be readable, easy to reason about, modular but without too much complexity. So with tests.
5. Code should be self-documented, comments are only for cases when they are really valuable.
6. Mark the task DONE in current prototype tasks file.
