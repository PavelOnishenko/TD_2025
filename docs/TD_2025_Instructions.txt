# Codex Instructions

For each task from tasks.txt:

1. Create a new branch named task-XXX (e.g. task-001).
2. Make only the changes required to complete the task.
3. Commit with message: feat(task-XXX): <short description>.
4. Push the branch to origin.
5. Create a real pull request on GitHub with the same title.
6. Don't touch the tasks file. I will mark tasks done myself when I will be sure they are completed.
7. Only after all that, move to the next task.
