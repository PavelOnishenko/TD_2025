Here are code style rules:
1. No more than 170 characters in line
2. Named functions no longer than 20 lines
3. Files not longer than 200 lines
4. Strict indentation, step is 4 characters
5. Extract method when same code is written 3 times or more
6. Create variable if value is evaluated 2 times or more
7. Meaningful names for everything
8. Code is self-explanatory, no comments where you can easily understand from code.
9. Class can be any concept. We can be creative with how we break down code into classes.
10. Always aim for "code perfect for right now", not some ideal code. Avoid premature optimization.
11. Testability is a good bonus but not strict requirement right now.
12. When extracting class or function, aim for even distribution of LOC between original entity and new entity.
