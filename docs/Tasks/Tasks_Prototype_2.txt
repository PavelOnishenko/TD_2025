001 | DONE | Add grid that shows 10 places to build towers along enemy path (which stays the same).
002 | DONE | Add a HUD above the canvas showing Lives=10, Gold=15, Wave=1/5, and buttons “Next Wave” and “Place Tower (10)”.
003 | DONE | Make “Place Tower (10)” toggle build mode and visually highlight when active.
004 | DONE | In build mode, highlight the hovered grid cell green if placeable and affordable, or red if blocked or unaffordable.
005 | DONE | Allow placing an tower on a green cell, deducting 10 Gold and marking the cell as occupied.
006 | DONE | Remove the pre-placed tower from Proto #1 so towers only appear when placed by the player. Initial money must be enough to buy 2 towers.
007 | DONE | Make “Next Wave” button start the current wave, disable the button during the wave, and spawn enemies along the waypoint path.
008 | DONE | Show enemy HP as a small visible bar above each enemy.
009 | DONE | Keep the existing tower attack from Proto #1 but adapt it to target any enemy within range in the new grid/path system. The logic I propose is to select the first enemy seen as target and when it goes out of sight, look for the next seen. Mb use queue or something like that.
010 | DONE | When an enemy is killed, grant +1 Gold and update the HUD immediately.
011 | DONE | Draw something that will signify base. When an enemy reaches the base, remove it and decrease Lives by 1 in the HUD.
012 | DONE | End a wave when all its enemies are gone, re-enable “Next Wave”, increase Wave by 1, and award +3 Gold.
013 | DONE | Increase wave difficulty by raising enemy HP per wave according to the spec. Store spec any way you deem appropriate. Remember, the main thing is development speed and nothing else.
014 | DONE | After Wave 5 ends and no enemies remain, show “WIN” in the HUD and stop the game.
015 | TODO | If Lives reach 0, show “LOSE” in the HUD and stop the game.
016 | TODO | Add a “Restart” button that resets Lives, Gold, Wave, and clears all towers and enemies.
