Prototype 3 — Task List

001 | DONE | Remove build mode toggle and highlighting logic from Prototype 2. Tapping an empty slot should always mean build attempt.
002 | DONE | Replace grid system with fixed tower slots. Arrange ~10 slots total: 5 on top row and 5 on bottom row, flanking the straight enemy path. Show empty slots as outlined circles or squares.
003 | DONE | Implement tower building: tap empty slot to place Level 1 tower (cost 10). If not enough gold, ignore and briefly highlight slot.
004 | DONE | Add color property to enemies: 'red' or 'blue'. Show by filling their sprite/rectangle.
005 | DONE | Add color property to towers. Default new tower = 'red'.
006 | DONE | Implement color damage rules: if tower.color = enemy.color → 1.0× damage, else 0.4× damage.
007 | DONE | Implement global switch cooldown system: one timer shared by all towers. Tap on a tower switches its color (red ↔ blue) only if cooldown = 0. Set cooldown = 2s.
008 | DONE | Add HUD indicator for switch cooldown (“Switch ready” bar or simple text).
009 | DONE | Implement auto-merge mechanic at end of wave: scan slots left to right; if two adjacent towers have same color and same level, merge into one tower (level+1), free second slot. Do only one merge pass per wave.
010 | DONE | Add Level 2 tower stats: +80% damage, +20% radius compared to Level 1.
012 | TODO | Add Swarm enemy type: low HP, high speed. Spawns in groups.
013 | DONE | Add Tank enemy type: very high HP, slow speed. Spawns in smaller numbers.

014 | DONE | Redefine wave system: 10 waves, 20–40s each.
    Waves 1–2: mono-color swarms.
    Wave 3+: introduce tanks.
    Later waves: mixed swarms and tanks, increasing randomness in colors (up to 50/50 mix).

015 | DONE | Update HUD: Lives, Gold, Wave X/10, cooldown indicator, tip text “Tap slot to build. Tap tower to switch (1 gold).”
016 | TODO | Balance constants: BUILD_COST=10, Lives=10, SwitchCooldown=2s (3s for L2), Damage multipliers (1.0 / 0.4), adjust HP/speed for swarm and tank enemies.
