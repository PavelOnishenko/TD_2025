001 | DONE | Endless mode support
After wave 10, continue spawning stronger enemies with scaling HP and spawn rate. Add endless mode indicator in HUD and maintain ad cadence.

002 | DONE | Endless mode balance and scaling
Fine-tune endless mode curve so difficulty increases steadily without spikes. Adjust wave rewards to keep progression stable.

003 | DONE | Accessibility improvements
Add basic accessibility support using ARIA. 
Add aria-pressed to all toggle buttons like Mute and Pause and update it dynamically when state changes. 
Wrap HUD elements that change text (wave, phase, energy, status) inside aria-live="polite" 
so screen readers announce updates. 
Ensure all buttons are focusable with Tab and have visible focus outlines.

004 | DONE | Add diagnostics overlay
Enable debug overlay toggle (key ~) showing FPS, wave, entities, and paused/muted flags. Hidden by default, useful for testing.

005 | DONE | Tutorial covers towers, not convenient. Need to make it so that it's easily visible but not
covering towers which are interactable.

006 | DONE | Base should be visible.
Just draw it on the canvas using shapes for now. 
The idea is that player will see where exactly the ships should not reach.

008 | CANCELLED | Because of large shots and the fact that there are a lot of them, 
Sometimes in battle it's hard to see where the towers are so I can click them and switch color.

008 | DONE | Buttons are overlapping in right bottom corner 
(Pause, sound and music buttons, also there is seemingly unused button without a label 
which PERHAPS can be safely removed 
AND in right top corner - endless mode indicator shows in the same place as other elements). Fix this.

009 | DONE | Remove tower ranges visual circles

010 | DONE | Add sound files we lack, look by list of required sound files in the code. 
Need human involvement

011 | DONE | Bug - music turns on in some situations despite it being turned off in HUD.
Situations include restart and ad display.

012 | TODO | Make smaller buttons for mobile (they cover the screen), possibly with some icons or abbreviated text. 
Icons can be sprites but may be svg as well. try to cover all image needs yourself.
Needs HUMAN.

013 | DONE | Add new formations for enemy ships. Now they are coming in portions of 1 (tank) or 3 (swarm), 3 swarms always going with the same X coord.
I want to have a tool to easily add new formations in text form. They should be in game config. Formation is defined by:
-list of ships
    -where each ship is defined by:
    -type (tank/swarm); 
    -relative position/time from the beginning of the wave (X coord essentially);
    -y coord showing how high the ship will go;
    -color;
-function that calculates probability of the formation based on number of wave p(wn)
-difficulty rank.
Formations will go one after another, no intersections. Their list is defined before the wave starts. 
They are chosen at random, respecting probabilities. For each wave there should be total difficulty.
difficulty ranking of all formaitons inside a wave should not exceed total difficulty of a wave.
EXAMPLE: we have total of 100 for curent wave.
We choose in random, getting: formation A with 34, B with 20, C with 15, D with 30, so we got 99 now, and we can't choose any more 
because we only have 100 - 99 = 1 difficulty point to "spend" and there are no such cheap formations.

014 | DONE | Instead of GIF background with space, draw stars algorithmically on the screen. Simple procedural generation.
Make the stars lightly glitter like they do in reality when u look at them.

015 | DONE | Draw portal from which the ships will go, also draw VFX for their emergence from the portal, and SFX to accompany that.
Don't put binary files in the repo, I will do it myself. Portal can be drawn with primitives I think.

016 | INPRO ME | Add sprites for tower level 4-6. Needs human.
Branch: towers

017 | DONE | Each next tower level should be shooting more frequently. 1st level should shoot 2 times per second. 
Level 3 should have spawnInterval of 60. Further levels - even less of this interval. 
The damage should be configured also so as not to change the difficulty of the game, it should remain like it was.

018 | DONE | When I focus another window, ships continue flying while shooting is being halted. 
This leads to losing. We need to fix this.

019 | TODO | Balance and gameplay test
Playtest on desktop and mobile. Verify average run time, win rate, ad timing, and responsiveness. 
Ensure no console errors or UI overlaps.
Need human.

020 | DONE | Cool animated splash screen for start overlay

021 | TODO | Tower level 4 shoots bullets like minigun, 
level 5 slowly recharging RAILGUN (like in quake 3) piercing through many enemies in one shot, 
level 6 shoots rockets that make cool LARGE EPIC EXPLOSIONS.
Make code for new SFX for shooting and getting hit for all these 3 levels because they will have different weapons
