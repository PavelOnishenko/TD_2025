001 | DONE | Endless mode support
After wave 10, continue spawning stronger enemies with scaling HP and spawn rate. Add endless mode indicator in HUD and maintain ad cadence.

002 | TODO | Endless mode balance and scaling
Fine-tune endless mode curve so difficulty increases steadily without spikes. Adjust wave rewards to keep progression stable.

003 | DONE | Accessibility improvements
Add basic accessibility support using ARIA. 
Add aria-pressed to all toggle buttons like Mute and Pause and update it dynamically when state changes. 
Wrap HUD elements that change text (wave, phase, energy, status) inside aria-live="polite" 
so screen readers announce updates. 
Ensure all buttons are focusable with Tab and have visible focus outlines.

004 | DONE | Add diagnostics overlay
Enable debug overlay toggle (key ~) showing FPS, wave, entities, and paused/muted flags. Hidden by default, useful for testing.

005 | TODO | Balance and gameplay test
Playtest on desktop and mobile. Verify average run time, win rate, ad timing, and responsiveness. 
Ensure no console errors or UI overlaps.

006 | TODO | Tutorial covers towers, not convenient. Need to make it so that it's easily visible but not 
covering towers which are interactable.

007 | TODO | Base should be visible.
Make some sprite that will represent it. Do not generate the image, I will put it in myself. 
Only some stub that I can easily make work 

008 | TODO | Because of large shots and the fact that there are a lot of them, 
Sometimes in battle it's hard to see where the towers are so I can click them and switch color.

009 | TODO | Buttons are overlapping in right bottom corner 
(Pause, sound and music buttons, also there is seemingly unused button without a label 
which PERHAPS can be safely removed 
AND in right top corner - endless mode indicator shows in the same place as other elements). Fix this.

010 | TODO | Remove tower ranges visual circles
