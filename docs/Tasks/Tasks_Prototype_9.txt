001 | TODO | Explosions for kills should be MUCH more epic and large. There should be burning debris flying away in all directions. 
    Also explosions when tanks die should be much larger than swarm's. 
002 | DONE | Towers should choose enemy matching by color when several are in range.
003 | DONE | Resolve all todos in the code.

004 | TODO | Tutorial system that gets tutorialStep objects from game config with these fields:
-name (shown as the title of tutorial window);
-wave number (at which wave's preparation phase to show the step);
-objects to highlight (those should be above the dark overlay so clearly seen along with the tutorial window)
    (mb we will have to create some simple global namespace where some program can pick objects from by name, 
    similar in idea to Unit's GameObjects and hierarchy. HUD elements should also be in that space)
-function to check whether the user has completed the tutorial step 
    (should somehow run periodically. 
    When it returns true, the tutorial is finished, the window and the dark overlay disappear)
-text to show in the window;
-picture asset to show in the window;
-sound asset to show in the window.
Also re-implement currently existing tutorial using this mechanism, NOT adding new steps to it for now.

005 | TODO | Global high score stored in the cloud. Need human to figure out what to use for that, where to store etc. 

006 | TODO | Make a tutorial using system implemented in p. 4.
It should cover the following:
-what it already covers - build, switch the color;
-tower merging;
-tower removal with long click;
-enemies of matching color get more damage;
-u get power for killing ships and finishing waves;
-there is score you get for killing and finishing waves. There is local highscore and global score rating (eg. top 20)
-plot point: Near Neon Empire capital planet a portal of unknown technology opened all of a sudden. 
    Scientists were assured this is going to be an alien invasion!
    Then it was decided to bring planetary defences up to the portal 
    so any threat would be destroyed right there should it ever come through the portal.
    New technology was used: living crystals. They are used to generate power and to form projectiles made from light.
    They can produce power right in the space but it takes time. 
    Living crystals also make good guns. if we put a laser ray through them, we get projectiles made of light.
    They turned out to be effective against aliens when the first few scounts flew in. 
    There were red and blue ships, so we prepared 2 kinds of living crystals - red and blue, tuned to different frequencies.
    They are only 30% effective against ships of non-matching color!
    Good luck in defending the Neon Empire!
-plot point on like wave 10 (Scientists have figured out that ancient weapons that were not used for centuries, 
    might work very well on aliens! Those are - machineguns, railguns and rockets!)

007 | TODO | Change text on splash screen. It should show "Neon Void" instead of minimal td as it is now.

008 | TODO | Add settings - sound, music, language - to the Pause menu.

009 | TODO | Add localization system. Localizations should be read from text files in assets. 2 languages need to work right away - English and Russian.
Switching should be placed somewhere in the HUD. Mb in the pause menu? All texts showing in the game should be subject to localization.

011 | TODO | Quality sounds

012 | TODO | Quality music

013 | TODO | Mb speech for the tutorial?
    
014 | TODO | (mb) Refactor for code re-use (extract engine logic for fuure games).
(when I will know what I am going to need for the next project, I am gonna separate those things as modules
and use them as engine library to quickly get the next one on rails)
