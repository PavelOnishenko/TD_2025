DONE 1. Show tower upgrade cost near tower.
DONE 2. New tutorial step - build 4 towers before 1st wave.
DONE 3. Merge tutorial - add step to make player get 2 towers ready for merge first, before clicking the button.
DONE 4. Draw lvl3 projectiles even when firing from 0 distance (possible?) 
5. Add energy from kills flying up to energy counter (animation)
6. Rail and rockets - show cool indicators when hit multiple enemies
7. Nerf level 3 towers
8. More screen shake for rockets, less for rail
9. Rail sound quieter, lvl4 sound louder
10. Bug with tutorial about removing towers - if player just skips it, all next tutorials are not working.
11. Map out some main strategies and define where they are expected to fail. Enforce that.
12. More difficulty for waves 1-20, and balance that.
13. Balance upgrades. Upgrades should start make sense since 15 level and should be a common way of playing since 20.
14. Increase visibility of tower level indicators
