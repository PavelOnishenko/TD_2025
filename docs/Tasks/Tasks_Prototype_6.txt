003 | TODO | Merge animation. Two towers should visually merge into one. 
    This should be accompanied by light explosion of some kind and SFX. 
004 | TODO | Show visual hint that 2 towers will merge at the end of the wave (when they are same color and same level). 
    It should work by the same algorithm that performs merging. 
    Possibility of these algorithms working even slightly differently must be eliminated.

006 | TODO |  SFX and VFX for "wrong color" hit should be different from "correct color" hit
007 | TODO | Make it so that merge is made on Combine button tap and not automatically
