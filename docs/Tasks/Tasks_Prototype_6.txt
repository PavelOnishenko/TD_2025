001 | CANCEL | VFX marking vacant cells - make it less distracting
002 | TODO | Merge animation. Two towers should visually merge into one. 
    This should be accompanied by light explosion of some kind and SFX. 
003 | TODO | Show visual hint that 2 towers will merge at the end of the wave (when they are same color and same level). 
    It should work by the same algorithm that performs merging. 
    Possibility of these algorithms working even slightly differently must be eliminated.
004 | TODO | VFX and SFX for switching color
005 | DONE | SFX and VFX for "wrong color" hit should be different from "correct color" hit
006 | TODO | Add tutorial
007 | DONE | Animation (like shake of the screen) and SFX when the base is hit
008 | DONE | Make different sprite for tanks
