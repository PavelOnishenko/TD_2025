# Analysis: Run 1014 - Wave 30 Achievement

## Overview
**Best run so far:** Reached wave 30
**Previous best:** Wave 26 (Run 728-2)
**Strategy:** Aggressive merging toward L6

## Key Milestones
- **Wave 15:** First L5 (railgun)
- **Wave 22:** First L6 (rockets) ← Goal was wave 18-20, slightly late
- **Wave 26:** Crisis point - lost 2 lives, used 300 energy upgrade
- **Wave 28:** Second L5 achieved
- **Wave 30:** Final wave - lost 1 life, died

## Crisis Analysis

### Wave 26 - The Breaking Point
- **Tower composition before:** 9L1, 0L2, 1L3, 1L4, 0L5, 1L6
- **Tower composition after:** 8L1, 1L2, 0L3, 2L4, 0L5, 1L6
- **Energy spent:** 300 (L1→L2 upgrade, desperate move)
- **Lives lost:** 2
- **Enemy count:** 44 (38 swarms + 6 tanks)
- **Wave duration:** 65 seconds (longest so far)

**What happened:** Player was building second L5 when wave hit. Insufficient firepower led to desperate upgrade mid-crisis.

### Waves 27-30 - Endgame Struggle
Despite having L6:
- Wave 27: 47 enemies, 37.3s
- Wave 28: 50 enemies, 50s - Finally got second L5
- Wave 29: 52 enemies, 27.7s
- Wave 30: 56 enemies, 40.1s - Death

**Pattern:** Enemy count and duration spiking. Even with 1 L6 + 1 L5, barely surviving.

## L6 Not a Win Button

### Expected
L6 is endgame tower, should dominate

### Reality
- Got L6 at wave 22
- Survived only 8 more waves
- Still needed to build second L5
- Still needed mixed composition support towers
- Wave 26-30 brutal despite having "ultimate" tower

### Why?
- Enemy scaling continues (1.1x HP per wave after wave 20)
- Difficulty increases (+2.4 per wave endless)
- AOE/piercing helps but isn't infinite scaling
- Need sustained DPS from multiple sources, not just burst

## Energy Economy

### Late Game Energy (Waves 22-30)
| Wave | Start Energy | Gained | Observation |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 22 | 137 | 350 | Good income |
| 26 | 34 | 493 | Spent 300 on upgrade |
| 30 | 136 | 646 | High income but doesn't matter |

**Finding:** Energy becomes more abundant late but still gets spent immediately on survival needs.

## What This Tells Us About Balance

### Good
1. **No dominant strategy:** Even L6 rush requires skill and support
2. **Tension maintained:** Still losing lives with endgame towers
3. **Energy stays tight:** Always something to spend on
4. **Gradual difficulty:** Waves 1-21 manageable, 22-30 intense

### Problems
1. **L6 timing late:** Wave 22 vs goal of wave 18-20
   - Possibly energy-gated?
   - Or merge pacing issue?

2. **Wave 26-30 spike:** Massive jump in difficulty
   - Is this intentional "wall"?
   - Or unbalanced scaling?

3. **Upgrade desperation:** Only upgrade used was panic at wave 26
   - Are upgrades too expensive to use proactively?
   - Should they be cheaper or more strategic?

## Comparison to Requirements

### Met Requirements ✓
- First-time players reach waves 10-20 ✓ (Run 728-1 died wave 14)
- Wave 30+ requires good strategy ✓ (Run 1014 needed optimal play)
- Energy never abundant ✓ (always spending)
- All tower levels useful ✓ (mixed comp at end: 7L1, 1L2, 1L3, 1L4, 1L5, 1L6)
- L6 necessary but not win button ✓

### Missed Requirements ⚠️
- **L6 by wave 18-20 with aggressive merging** ⚠️ Achieved wave 22 instead

### Unknown
- Can wave 40 be reached with perfect strategy + luck?
- Are advanced techniques viable or is wave 30 the ceiling?

## Recommended Next Test

**Don't** test L6 rush again - we know it's ~wave 22
**Do** test: Can we push past wave 30?

Options:
1. **Upgrade-heavy strategy:** Use upgrades more liberally, see if that helps
2. **Color optimization:** Focus on color matching efficiency
3. **Different merge path:** Try alternative compositions

Or just accept wave 30 as current ceiling and optimize for that goal.
