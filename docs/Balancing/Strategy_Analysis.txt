PART 1: WAVE-BY-WAVE SIMULATION
================================================================================

Assumptions for calculations:
- Average enemy count per wave ≈ difficulty / 3 (rough estimate)
- Swarms are more common than tanks (ratio ~3:1)
- Enemy speed: 200 (swarm), 100 (tank) with 0.9 multiplier
- Path length: estimated ~1400 units (need to verify from code)
- Time in range varies by tower level (longer range = more time)

Wave Data Table:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Wave | Diff | HP   | Est Enemies | Swarm HP | Tank HP  | Est Total HP
-----|------|------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------
  1  | 13   | 1.34 |    ~10      |  13.4    |  47.8    |   ~200
  2  | 13   | 1.64 |    ~10      |  16.4    |  58.5    |   ~245
  3  | 14   | 1.94 |    ~11      |  19.4    |  69.3    |   ~310
  4  | 14   | 2.24 |    ~11      |  22.4    |  80.0    |   ~370
  5  | 15   | 2.53 |    ~12      |  25.3    |  90.3    |   ~445
  6  | 15   | 2.97 |    ~12      |  29.7    | 106.0    |   ~525
  7  | 16   | 3.20 |    ~13      |  32.0    | 114.2    |   ~610
  8  | 16   | 3.42 |    ~13      |  34.2    | 122.1    |   ~650
  9  | 17   | 3.65 |    ~14      |  36.5    | 130.3    |   ~745
 10  | 17   | 3.87 |    ~14      |  38.7    | 138.2    |   ~790
 11  | 18   | 4.10 |    ~15      |  41.0    | 146.4    |   ~895
 12  | 18   | 4.32 |    ~15      |  43.2    | 154.2    |   ~945
 13  | 19   | 4.55 |    ~16      |  45.5    | 162.4    |  ~1060
 14  | 19   | 4.77 |    ~16      |  47.7    | 170.3    |  ~1110
 15  | 20   | 5.00 |    ~17      |  50.0    | 178.5    |  ~1235
 16  | 20   | 5.22 |    ~17      |  52.2    | 186.4    |  ~1295
 17  | 21   | 5.00 |    ~18      |  50.0    | 178.5    |  ~1310

 19  | 22   | 5.45 |    ~19      |  54.5    | 194.6    |  ~1510
 20  | 22   | 5.65 |    ~19      |  56.5    | 201.6    |  ~1565

Notes:
- Total HP is rough estimate assuming 3:1 swarm:tank ratio
- Actual counts vary due to random formation selection
- These are MINIMUM values; actual waves may be harder

Energy Projection:
------------------
Starting: 480 energy

Assuming average 10 kills/wave × 7 energy + 40 wave bonus:
Wave 1 end: 480 + 110 = 590
Wave 2 end: 590 + 110 = 700
Wave 3 end: 700 + 115 = 815
Wave 4 end: 815 + 115 = 930
Wave 5 end: 930 + 120 = 1050
Wave 6 end: 1050 + 120 = 1170
Wave 7 end: 1170 + 125 = 1295
Wave 8 end: 1295 + 125 = 1420
Wave 9 end: 1420 + 130 = 1550
Wave 10 end: 1550 + 135 = 1685 (bonuses start)
Wave 15 end: ~2500 energy (upgrades unlock)
Wave 20 end: ~3500 energy

(These are conservative estimates - actual may be higher)

================================================================================
PART 2: STRATEGY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STRATEGY A: MASS LEVEL 1 SPAM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Concept: Build as many Level 1 towers as possible, never merge or upgrade

Stats:
- Cost per tower: 120 energy
- Max towers: 12
- Total cost: 1440 energy
- Total DPS: 12 × 16.6 = 199.2 DPS
- Range: 182 (limited coverage)

Wave-by-Wave Viability:

Wave 1-4: ✓ VIABLE
- Can afford 4-7 towers
- 66-116 DPS available
- Total enemy HP: ~200-370
- Low HP enemies die quickly

Wave 5-7: ⚠️ TIGHT
- Can afford 8-10 towers
- 133-166 DPS available
- Total enemy HP: ~445-610
- Starting to struggle with tankier enemies
- Level 1 takes 3-4 shots on swarms, 7-10 shots on tanks

Wave 8-10: ❌ FAILING
- Can afford 11-12 towers (grid limit reached!)
- 183-199 DPS available
- Total enemy HP: ~650-790
- Time-to-kill exceeds safe margins
- Level 1 takes 5 shots per swarm (2.5s), 17 shots per tank (8.5s)
- Tanks will leak through with limited range

Wave 11+: ❌ IMPOSSIBLE
- Already at max towers (12)
- No way to increase DPS
- Enemy HP keeps scaling
- Complete failure

**Verdict: Mass Level 1 should FAIL by Wave 8-10**

Failure Symptoms:
- Grid slots full but still losing
- Towers can't kill fast enough
- Tanks walking through due to limited range
- Player has energy but nowhere to spend it effectively

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STRATEGY B: RUSH MERGING (Get Level 3-4 ASAP)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Concept: Merge aggressively to get high-level towers early

Example path:
- Wave 1: Build 4 Level 1s (480 energy)
- Wave 2: Merge to 2 Level 2s, build more
- Wave 3-5: Rush to Level 3s (very fast balls - 66.67 DPS!)
- Wave 6-10: Mix of Level 3-4 towers
- Wave 11+: Start pushing to Level 5 (railgun with piercing!)

Stats for early Level 3:
- Cost: 4 Level 1s merged = 480 energy → 1 Level 3
- DPS: 66.67 (4× more than Level 1!)
- Range: 254.8 (much better coverage)
- Weapon: Very fast balls (single target)

Stats for Level 4:
- Cost: 8 Level 1s merged = 960 energy → 1 Level 4
- DPS: 75.83 (4.5× more than Level 1!)
- Range: 291.2
- Weapon: Machinegun bursts (single target)

Wave-by-Wave Viability:

Wave 1-2: ⚠️ RISKY
- Only 2-4 towers active
- Limited coverage
- If towers poorly positioned, may leak
- High skill requirement

Wave 3-5: ✓ STRONG
- Have 1-2 Level 3s (very fast fire rate)
- Good single-target DPS
- Good range coverage
- 133-166 DPS from fewer towers

Wave 6-12: ✓ VERY STRONG
- Multiple Level 3-4 towers
- Excellent single-target DPS
- Good range
- Energy spent on quality over quantity
- Can start working toward Level 5

Wave 13-15: ⚠️ PLATEAUING
- Level 3-4s still good but enemy HP scaling
- Grid filling up
- Need to start getting Level 5 (railgun!)
- Upgrades unlock at wave 15

Wave 16+: ❌ NEEDS EVOLUTION
- Level 3-4 alone not enough
- Must get Level 5 (railgun piercing!) or Level 6 (rockets AoE!)
- Upgrades unlock at wave 15, should be using them

**Verdict: Rush merging is STRONGEST in waves 6-15, but requires skill early and evolution late**

Failure Symptoms:
- Waves 1-2: Leaks due to poor coverage
- Waves 16+: Need to evolve strategy, stuck on Level 3-4 without multi-target weapons

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STRATEGY C: BALANCED BUILD & MERGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Concept: Build for coverage, merge when efficient, adapt to each wave

Example path:
- Wave 1-3: Build 6-8 Level 1s for solid coverage
- Wave 4-6: Start merging to Level 2s
- Wave 7-10: Mix of Level 2-3 (6-8 towers total)
- Wave 11-15: Push some towers to Level 3-4
- Wave 15+: Use upgrades when merging isn't possible

Stats:
- Flexible energy allocation
- Maintains good coverage
- Gradually increases tower quality

Wave-by-Wave Viability:

Wave 1-20: ✓ VIABLE (with good play)
- Always adapts to current challenge
- Balances coverage vs tower quality
- Uses energy efficiently
- Most forgiving of mistakes

**Verdict: Balanced approach is VIABLE LONGEST but requires most skill**

Failure Symptoms:
- Player makes poor merge decisions
- Over-commits to either building or merging
- Runs out of energy at critical moments
- Poor positioning leaves gaps

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STRATEGY D: UPGRADE-HEAVY (Post-Wave 15)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Concept: Rely on upgrade system instead of merging

Stats:
- Upgrades cost 300-5000 energy
- Available from wave 15
- Can upgrade without losing coverage

Analysis:
Upgrade L1→L2: 300 energy, +23.4 DPS, keeps coverage ✓ GOOD
Upgrade L2→L3: 600 energy, +26.67 DPS, keeps coverage ✓ EXCELLENT
Upgrade L3→L4: 1200 energy, +9.16 DPS ⚠️ EXPENSIVE
Upgrade L4→L5: 2500 energy, -28.21 DPS ❌ TRAP! (only for range?)
Upgrade L5→L6: 5000 energy, +19 DPS + AoE ⚠️ VERY EXPENSIVE

Comparing to merging:
- Merge 2×L1→L2: Cost 240, net +6.8 DPS, -1 tower
- Upgrade L1→L2: Cost 300, +23.4 DPS, keeps coverage
- **Upgrade is BETTER for DPS, worse for coverage**

Wave-by-Wave Viability:

Wave 1-14: ❌ NOT AVAILABLE

Wave 15-17: ✓ USEFUL SUPPLEMENT
- Can upgrade to fill gaps when grid is full
- Expensive but effective
- Should NOT be primary strategy

Wave 18-20: ✓ NECESSARY
- Grid likely full or nearly full
- Only way to increase power
- Must use upgrades to survive

**Verdict: Upgrades are ESSENTIAL late game but too expensive to rely on exclusively**

Failure Symptoms:
- Running out of energy
- Trying to upgrade too early
- Falling for L4→L5 trap
- Not merging when it's more efficient

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STRATEGY E: MINIMAL TOWER / EFFICIENCY RUN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Concept: Beat waves with as few towers as possible (challenge mode)

Requirements:
- Perfect positioning
- Perfect timing on merges
- Optimal tower upgrades
- Color management

Likely limit: ~Wave 10-15 before it becomes impossible

**Verdict: Fun challenge but not sustainable**

================================================================================
PART 3: CRITICAL BREAKPOINTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

DESIGNED FAILURE POINTS:
------------------------

Wave 1-5: Tutorial Phase
→ Any strategy works
→ Teach building, merging, color switching

Wave 6-8: First Skill Check - "Can you merge?"
→ Pure Level 1 spam starts struggling
→ Players should have some Level 2s
→ Merging should feel rewarding

Wave 9-12: Second Skill Check - "Can you manage economy?"
→ Level 1 spam completely fails
→ Need mix of Level 2-3-4
→ High DPS towers become valuable
→ Energy management matters

Wave 13-15: Third Skill Check - "Can you optimize composition?"
→ Need multiple Level 3-4s or start pushing to Level 5 (railgun!)
→ Must plan ahead for upgrades (unlock at wave 15)
→ Tower positioning critical

Wave 15: MAJOR MILESTONE - Upgrades Unlock
→ Game changes significantly
→ New strategic options
→ Should feel like power spike

Wave 16-20: Endgame - "Master everything"
→ Must use upgrades
→ Grid optimization critical
→ Perfect play required
→ All strategies converge to "max level towers"

Wave 21+: Endless Mode
→ Continuous scaling
→ See how far you can go
→ Pure optimization challenge

================================================================================
PART 4: BALANCE TUNING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Current Issues to Consider:

1. **Level 4→5 Upgrade is a TRAP**
   - Costs 2500 energy
   - DECREASES DPS by 28
   - Only benefit is +36 range
   - Recommendation: Either buff L5 damage or reduce cost

2. **Level 1 Spam Might Fail Too Late**
   - Currently fails around wave 8-10
   - Might want it to fail by wave 6-7
   - Solution: Increase enemy HP slightly for waves 6-8

3. **Rush Merging to Level 5 Might Be Too Strong**
   - Level 5 Railgun piercing is VERY powerful if achieved early
   - Early Level 5 could dominate waves 12-18 if reached
   - However, getting Level 5 requires huge investment (16 Level 1s!)
   - Likely balanced by difficulty of achieving it

4. **Energy Economy Might Be Too Generous**
   - By wave 10, player has ~1685 energy (14 towers worth!)
   - Grid only holds 12
   - Maybe reduce energy gains to make choices harder?

5. **Upgrade Costs Are Steep**
   - L5→L6 costs 5000 energy (41 towers worth!)
   - By wave 20, might only have ~3500 total energy
   - Consider: Reduce L5→L6 cost to 3000-3500?

6. **Missing Strategy: Pure Upgrade Path**
   - Is there a viable "never merge, only upgrade" strategy?
   - Currently seems impossible (upgrades too expensive)
   - Might be intentional design

================================================================================
PART 5: SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR TESTING
================================================================================

Need to verify by playing:

1. How long does a typical wave last?
   → Affects time-to-kill calculations

2. What's the actual enemy count variance per wave?
   → My estimates might be off

3. How much does Level 5 railgun piercing help in practice?
   → Single-target DPS (47.62) might underestimate L5 true value
   → Against groups could be 150-240+ effective DPS

4. How much does Level 6 rocket AoE help?
   → Single-target DPS (66.67) might underestimate L6 true value
   → Against groups could be 200-330+ effective DPS

5. What's the actual energy gain by wave 10/15/20?
   → Need real data to validate projections

6. Can Level 1 spam actually reach wave 10?
   → Or does it fail earlier than calculated?

7. Is rushing Level 3-4 actually viable?
   → Or do early waves punish low tower count too hard?

8. Can players realistically get Level 5 by wave 15?
   → Requires 16 Level 1s worth of energy (1920) + merges
   → Is this achievable and worth it?

8. What's the player's actual income per wave?
   → Kill counts, wave bonuses, etc.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Playtest each strategy to verify theoretical breakpoints
2. Record actual energy income per wave
3. Measure enemy counts and total HP per wave
4. Note where strategies actually fail vs theoretical
5. Adjust balance knobs accordingly
6. Document intended strategy progression for players
