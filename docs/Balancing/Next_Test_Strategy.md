# Next Test Strategy: Aggressive L6 Rush

## Goal
Get one L6 tower before wave 20 with aggressive merging.

## Strategy Details

### Waves 1-3: Foundation Building
- **Action:** Build L1 towers only
- **Target:** Fill both sides (up to 12 towers total)
- **Energy:** Spend all available on tower placement
- **Don't:** Merge yet, maximize tower count first

### Wave 4-6: Start Merging
- **Action:** Create L2 towers whenever you have adjacent L1 pairs
- **Priority:** Focus merging on ONE side only
- **Other side:** Keep as L1-L2 baseline defense
- **Pattern:** Start building toward 654321 composition on primary side

### Waves 7-10: Progressive Merging
- **Action:** Continue merging on primary side
- **Target:** Reach L3-L4 towers on primary side
- **Secondary side:** Minimal merging, maintain firepower
- **Critical:** Never merge during waves, only between waves
- **Maintain:** Minimum 8-10 active towers at all times

### Waves 11-15: Aggressive Push
- **Action:** Heavy merging toward L5
- **Target:** Get first L5 (railgun) by wave 15
- **Secondary side:** Can upgrade to L2-L3 for survival
- **Total L1s needed for L5:** 16 (merged progressively)
- **Total merges needed:** 15

### Waves 16-19: Final Sprint to L6
- **Action:** Build and merge remaining L1s for second L5
- **Target:** Get 32 L1s total (across all previous waves) → 31 merges → L6
- **Critical:** Time merges between waves to avoid vulnerability
- **Expected:** L6 completion by wave 18-19

### Wave 20+: Survive
- **Action:** See how long you survive with L6
- **Goal:** Determine if L6 is strong enough for wave 20+
- **Track:** When do you start losing lives after getting L6

## Data to Record

### During Test
- Exact wave when L5 appears
- Exact wave when L6 appears
- Total energy spent vs total energy earned each wave
- Lives remaining at wave 20
- Wave where first life is lost after L6

### After Test
- Final wave reached
- How much "breathing room" existed after L6
- Whether survival felt luck-based or skill-based
- If L6 felt necessary, overpowered, or balanced

## Success Criteria
- L6 achieved by wave 18-20
- At least 3 lives remaining at wave 20
- Strategy feels intentional, not forced
- Merge timing creates tension but not frustration

## Failure Indicators
- Can't get enough L1 towers to reach L6 by wave 20
- Die before wave 18 while trying to rush
- L6 achievement feels too easy (by wave 15 or earlier)
- Energy starvation prevents necessary tower placement
