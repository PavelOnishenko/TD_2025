# Winning Strategy

To survive all waves:

1. **Build early** – Spend your starting gold on five towers before the first wave. Place them so they cover both lanes.
2. **Match colors** – Enemies take full damage from projectiles of the same color. Switch tower colors when waves change.
3. **Merge wisely** – After each wave, adjacent towers of the same color and level merge into stronger ones. Plan your placements to merge and upgrade.
4. **Focus fire** – Target tanks with upgraded towers while swarms are handled by multiple basic towers.
5. **Stay reactive** – Watch cooldowns and switch colors to counter mixed enemy colors.

Playing with these tactics should allow you to defeat waves with a good chance of success.
