EVA GAME - COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Based on MessagesFromVdm_2025_12_31.txt
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Eva Game is a classic 2D beat'em up in a dark cyberpunk setting featuring two
playable characters (Eva and Taras) who become cops in a world of endless chaos.
The game emphasizes cooperative gameplay, environmental interaction, and
progression through unlockable gear and challenges.

GAME VISION
-----------
Setting: Dark cyberpunk (Judge Dredd Stallone film aesthetic)
- Grim alleyways, gang warfare, fires and destruction in early levels
- Progressively cleaner, more sci-fi advanced districts in later levels

Characters:
- Taras: Paratrooper stuck in time loop for 1000+ years, loves fighting
- Eva: Terrorist/inventor/saboteur/genius fighter, loves combat

Story: Two ultra-powerful fighters sent to hardcore world by "The Viewer"
(multiversal entity). They won battle royale, chose to be sent to endless
combat world. Become cops "for fun" to bring order to chaos.

Core Gameplay: Classic 2D beat'em up with Battletoads-style depth movement

PHASE 1: CORE BEAT'EM UP MECHANICS
================================================================================

1.1 MOVEMENT SYSTEM
-------------------
CURRENT STATE:
✓ Basic 8-directional movement

================================================================================
NOTES AND CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

SCOPE MANAGEMENT:
-----------------
- This is a LARGE scope. Start with MVP and iterate.
- Many features can be simplified initially (placeholder graphics, basic VFX)
- Focus on feel and gameplay first, polish later
- Don't try to implement everything at once

ENGINE EXTRACTION:
------------------
- Follow prototyping methodology: build in eva_game/ first
- Only extract to engine/ when a second game needs the same system
- Keep game-specific logic out of engine components

COMPLEXITY CONCERNS:
--------------------
From MessagesFromVdm: "I'd like advanced environmental interaction, BUT this
will probably be too complex and won't happen, but just describing what I'd
like anyway."

RESPONSE: We can implement simplified version for MVP:
- Breakable objects (simple)
- Basic throw interaction (medium)
- Special effects on interaction (simple to medium)
- Full physics-based interaction can come later if desired

TWO-PLAYER FOCUS:
-----------------
- Design all systems with 2-player in mind from the start
- Grab-and-hold mechanic is CRITICAL for cooperative gameplay
- Balance difficulty for both solo and duo play
- Ensure camera works well with two players

VISUAL STYLE:
-------------
- Can start with simple geometric shapes (current style)
- Add sprite sheets progressively
- Cyberpunk aesthetic through color palette and VFX
- Dark backgrounds, neon highlights, particle effects


================================================================================
DEVELOPMENT PHASES TIMELINE (ROUGH ESTIMATE)
================================================================================

Note: These are implementation phases, not time estimates.
Each phase may take varying amounts of effort.

Phase 1-2: Core beat'em up mechanics + two-player = Foundation
Phase 3-4: Environment + levels = World building
Phase 5: Progression = Replayability
Phase 6: Polish = "Juice" and feel
Phase 7: UI = User experience
Phase 8: Advanced mechanics = Depth
Phase 9: Content = Game length
Phase 10: Optimization = Release ready


================================================================================
QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE REFINEMENT
================================================================================

1. Sprite art vs geometric shapes?
   - Stick with shapes for rapid prototyping?
   - Pixel art sprites later?

2. How many levels minimum for first release?
   - 3 levels?
   - 5 levels?
   - 7+ levels?

3. Difficulty settings?
   - Single difficulty?
   - Easy/Normal/Hard?

4. Controller support priority?
   - Keyboard only initially?
   - Gamepad support from start?

5. Localization?
   - English only?
   - Russian + English?
   - More languages?

6. Special moves complexity?
   - Simple (just powerful attacks)?
   - Complex (meter management, strategic use)?


================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing
Eva Game from its current prototype state into a full-featured 2D beat'em up.

The plan is intentionally large-scale to capture the full vision. Implementation
should proceed incrementally, focusing on getting a fun, playable core before
expanding to all features.

Next steps:
1. Review this plan
2. Prioritize features
3. Begin with Phase 1 (Enhanced movement and combat)
4. Build iteratively, testing frequently
5. Refine based on playability and feedback

The game has a clear vision and interesting cooperative mechanics. The grab-and-
hold system for two players is particularly unique and should be a focus.

Looking forward to building this!
